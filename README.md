# PRODIGY_CS-01
Cesear Cipher Implementation

This project implements a user-friendly Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt messages interactively.

Features üìù:

- User Interface: Offers an intuitive graphical or command-line interface for easy interaction.
- Encryption: Converts plain text into encrypted text by shifting each letter in the message by a specified number of positions.
- Decryption: Converts encrypted text back into plain text using the reverse shift of the encryption process.
- Shift Value: Enables users to specify how many positions each letter in the message should be shifted (integer input).
- Input Handling: Ensures reliable handling of user inputs for messages and shift values.
- Output Display: Clearly presents encrypted or decrypted messages to the user for easy comprehension.

Usage Instructions:

- Getting Started: Launch the program and interact via the interface.
- Enter your message: [input your message here]
- Enter the shift value (integer): [input your shift value here]
- Encrypt or Decrypt? (E/D): [input 'E' for encryption or 'D' for decryption]
- Result Display: View the resulting encrypted or decrypted message directly in the interface.
